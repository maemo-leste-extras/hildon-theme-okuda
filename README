How to create a new theme by using this customization point (cp)
================================================================
By Xun Chen <xun.chen@nokia.com>

1. Modify colors (even shapes, as long as they stay inside the boxes) of widgets from image file template/template.png, with any image creation or drawing tools, e.g., Gimp.

2. Or, not recommended, change the size of widgets which presented in both template/template.png and layout.txt in another package hildon-theme-layout-5 to be matched each other.

3. Give your theme following parameters in conf/hilton-hildon-theme-variant.confml:
   - ThemeDir: where to install your theme under /usr/share/theme) 
   - ThemeName: your theme's name

4. Build the package, your new looking theme will be available.

5. This cp will not set the new theme as default, but another cp 'theme-default-settings-template' will.
